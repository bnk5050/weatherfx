# weatherfx
A Java desktop application I built to display the weather for a given location.  Libraries I used include JavaFX, Jackson, and Apache HttpClient.

### Why did I build it?
I really enjoy watching weather patterns and learning about meterology.  I also find learning much more interesting when I can apply some real-world application or concepts to it.  This project has been a way for me to practice and challenge myself in real time while I developed the program.  It certainly isn't perfect, but I had a great time working through some of the challenges and plan to continue learning from it. 

### How to build and run the application
To build the application, open the project in NetBeans.  Include the following libraries and run the application:
- OpenJDK
- Jackson
- Apache HttpClient

### What is next?
Initially, I thought I might add some basic input validation functions to ensure the user is entering valid zip codes or cities.  I've been studying Java quite a bit lately, and I've learned some new concepts that I'd like to incorporate into the design as well.  Here are some features that I would like to add or changes I'd like to make:

- Validate user input.
- Remove the hard coded API key.
- Add a 3 day forecast option by parsing the API response into an appropriate data structure. 
- Clean up the source code to remove uneeded commented-out code (good code recudes the need for comments!)
- Convert the project into a Maven project to manage the dependencies and eliminate the need to use NetBeans.
